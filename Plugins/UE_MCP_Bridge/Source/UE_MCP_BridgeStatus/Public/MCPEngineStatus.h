/**
 * A picture of what the engine is doing, kept up to date by the game thread and
 * readable by everyone else.
 *
 * Every other sensor in the bridge routes through FMCPGameThreadExecutor, so
 * the instant the game thread stops returning to the tick loop - a modal
 * dialog, a long FSlowTask, a hitching import - every request degrades to
 * "Handler execution timed out" and the caller learns nothing about why. This
 * class answers that question from outside:
 *
 *   - the game thread refreshes the snapshot from hooks that keep firing while
 *     a long operation or a modal dialog owns the main loop, which is exactly
 *     when the core ticker is suspended;
 *   - the socket thread serves the snapshot directly, never scheduling game
 *     thread work;
 *   - a writer thread flushes it to Saved/UE_MCP_Bridge/status.json so the
 *     state survives a genuinely wedged process and is readable before a
 *     WebSocket client has connected at all.
 *
 * This lives in its own module so it can load at PostConfigInit, long before
 * the bridge module (PostEngineInit). Its two Core-only hooks - the core
 * ticker and, on UE 5.8+, FCoreDelegates::ApplicationHeartbeat, which every
 * slow-task progress frame broadcasts - cover the entire startup window that
 * used to be invisible: asset registry scan, startup shader compilation, map
 * load. Earlier engine versions have no heartbeat delegate; see Install() for
 * what covers those frames there and what it costs.
 *
 * Sources that need Slate or Engine are injected by the bridge module when it
 * loads (SetModalProvider / SetCompileProvider / CaptureNow from Slate ticks),
 * because neither is reliably up at PostConfigInit.
 *
 * Every field is guarded by a single critical section. Captures are cheap
 * (reading GWarn's scope stack and two counters), so running one per Slate
 * tick is noise next to the frame itself.
