 * The engine-status snapshot, split out so it can load at PostConfigInit -
 * long before the bridge module (PostEngineInit) exists. Everything the
 * editor does between those two points (asset registry scan, startup shader
 * compilation, map load, the prompts that fire during them) used to be
 * invisible to ue-mcp because nothing of ours was loaded yet.
 *
 * Dependencies are deliberately minimal: Core carries the slow-task scope
 * stack, the application heartbeat (UE 5.8+) and the threading needed to
 * publish the snapshot. Slate and Engine are NOT dependencies - they are not reliably
 * up this early, so the bridge module injects those richer sources
 * (modal-dialog description, shader/asset compile counts) when it loads.
