 * talks to this one bridge, the registry has to live here to serialize across
 * agents (or an agent plus a human).
 *
 * Locks carry a session id and a TTL. A crashed or disconnected agent never
 * wedges an asset: the lease simply expires and the next acquire reclaims it.
 * Re-acquiring a lock you already hold (same session) just refreshes the lease,
 * so a single agent never blocks itself across a multi-step operation.
 *
 * All handler execution is marshalled onto the game thread, so these operations
 * are already serialized; the critical section is defence-in-depth for the
 * List()/expiry paths.
