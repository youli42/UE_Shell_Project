	// gate and from the GEditor check. A modal raised during startup blocks the
	// game thread before the editor is ever marked ready, so gating the dialog
	// handlers on readiness made the block permanent: the gate was held shut by
	// the dialog those calls exist to dismiss, and the only escape was an OS
	// kill. The two exemptions travel together because they describe one
	// property - this handler is how a blocked engine gets unblocked, so no
