/**
 * #881: scrub_sequence has to be reachable, and a request it cannot honour has
 * to be an error rather than a reported position it never moved to.
 *
 * The assertions here are the ones that hold whatever the editor happens to
 * have open. A call with no parameters is refused either because no sequence is
 * open or because neither seconds nor frame was given, and both are the same
 * statement: the action does not answer with a position it did not scrub to.
 * Anything that needs a sequence open in Sequencer belongs to the live tier,
 * because a test that opened one would be driving the editor hosting it.
